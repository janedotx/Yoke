sai's phone has android 9

maximum 5 apps can be banned

streak stuff seems to be working in the following situations:
midnight reset (I saw 2/2)
app redeploy to phone (no change in 2/2)
force app restart (no change in 1/1)
android random act of death (no change in 1/1)

as soon as the usage settings permission is granted, the ManagerService can shoot the app limit screen

since we're having that checkmark in the UI to switch the type of a todo from daily to oneoff and skipping out on syncing with other todo apps for now, every todo is a Habit behind the scenes now.
