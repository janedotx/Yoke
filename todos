Welcome!

Hobbes will help you control how much you use your phone, and get more done in the real world.

How it works
You'll choose the apps that you want to restrict your time on. For example, you might want to limit your time on Twitter. Every day, you'll start out with some minutes that you can spend on Twitter and other restricted apps. Once you run out, Hobbes will display your todo list. You can earn more time by doing todos.

First, though, Hobbes will need your permission to access usage stats. This is so Hobbes can tell when you've run out of time on a restricted app.
